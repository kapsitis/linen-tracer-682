This topic can include other computable rankings of search results – including “recommendation problem”, where we have many users, some users have preferences that are well-known; the problem is to find similar users who might prefer the same things. This is used by Google, Netflix and many other service providers when there are thousands of options to choose from, but we want to recommend just the things that are most likely to match the given user’s preferences.",

This result is less relevant for national elections (because they do not happen often enough to allow manipulation scenarios described by Arrow), but this is important for shareholder decision making and other business applications where multiple users vote accordingly to their self-interest (but eventually the result of their voting turns out to be harmful to the self interest of the majority – no matter, how the voting procedure is organized).
